           <p className='mt-5'>Founded in January 2023, the Senior - DCD Discord Server offers Daily Contest Discussions (DCDs) to anyone who wants them. We are now a successful community of contributors with a lot going on.</p>
           <p>The DCDs for Codeforces, Codechef, and at times Atcoder and Leetcode are also available. As part of our mentoring program, we organize regular sessions.</p>
           <p>So far, we have conducted 3 webinars in different colleges, and invited people to speak to our audience as well. Each of the sessions is on our YouTube channel.</p>
